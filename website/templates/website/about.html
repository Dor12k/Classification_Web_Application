                <p>
                    In my project, I utilized a diverse stack of technologies to build a full-scale web and mobile application. 
                    On the backend, I developed the core functionality using <b>Django</b> and <b>Python</b>, managing server-side logic and data processing. 
                    For the frontend, I used <b>HTML, CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>, ensuring a user-friendly interface, all within the <b>Visual Studio Code</b> environment.
                </p><br>
                
                <p>
                    To build and train the AI model for classifying strawberry diseases, I worked <b>Google Colab</b> and employed popular libraries such as <b>TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib</b>, and <b>os</b> for data processing, model building, and visualization.
                    You can read more about our model <a href="{% url "article_page" 2 %}"><b>here</b></a>.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    The project was deployed on <b>AWS EC2</b> for hosting the web server, with <b>Nginx</b> as the reverse proxy, and I used <b>Docker</b> for containerization. 
                    Additionally, I utilized <b>AWS S3</b> for storage, ensuring data availability and security.
                    For data management, I integrated <b>PostgreSQL</b> as the database system, hosted on <b>AWS RDS</b> (Relational Database Service). 
                    The TensorFlow model was deployed using a serverless SageMaker endpoint.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    The Android application, built using <b>Android Studio</b> with <b>Java</b>, features <b>TensorFlow</b> Lite for on-device AI predictions, allowing users to classify strawberry plant diseases directly from their mobile devices.
